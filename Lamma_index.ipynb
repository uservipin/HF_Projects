This overall slowdown was primarily driven by global factors, including weakened investor sentiment and persistent macroeconomic headwinds, such as high interest rates, softening consumption, and geopolitical tensions.\\n\\nThe decline in India was largely driven by a ~60% reduction in VC investments due to their exposure to high-growth businesses with less established economic models. PE investments remained comparatively resilient, declining by a more moderate ~20% as large-scale dealmaking ($500M+ deals) persisted for high-quality assets.\\n\\nAmidst the overall decline in PE-VC investments, traditional sectors remained comparatively resilient, declining moderately by ~15% as investors continued to deploy capital for businesses with mature operating economics and secular growth characteristics.\\n\\nWithin traditional sectors, healthcare investments reached a record high of ~$5.5 billion in 2023 on the back of provider investments surging to approximately three times that of 2022 levels, fueled by ongoing consolidation in multi-specialty providers and the emergence of scale single-specialty assets with attractive business profiles. Advanced manufacturing also witnessed relatively higher activity, with investments growing by ~20% per annum over 2021-2023, driven by global supply chain diversification and government incentives. Notable activity was seen in electric vehicle (EV) original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) (with numerous $100M+ deals driven by growing EV penetration) and packaging (with multiple $100M+ deals into companies with 70%+ sales from exports).\\n\\nConversely, software as a service (SaaS) and new-age tech investing declined sharply, by ~60%. This decrease in SaaS investment was partly because assets that were well-funded, had strong operational economics, and had high valuations opted to stay out of the market. Meanwhile, investments in new-age tech decreased as investors increasingly prioritized the viability of the business model and proven economic performance.\\n\\nDespite the slowdown in dealmaking, 2023 was a marquee year for Indian exits. Exit value soared by ~15% to ~$29 billion, accompanied by a rise in exit volume from ~210 to ~340 exits. This was powered by public market sales (notably block trades) which comprised half of exits by value. These sales benefited from the increasingly deep Indian public markets, which outperformed those of most major economies, with a significant increase in domestic investor participation across sectors and companies.\\n\\nIndia is playing an increasingly significant role in Asia-Pacific PE-VC activity. It accounted for ~20% of all PE-VC investments in 2023, up from ~15% in 2018. This has led to a rise in capital from both domestic and global/regional funds, who are now diversifying across various sectors and asset classes within India. As existing investors double down on India and new investors enter the market, India-based teams have expanded significantly; scale funds have almost doubled their teams since 2019.\\n\\nIn recent times, as deal flow slows down and interest rates rise, Indian funds are placing more emphasis on portfolio and value creation. This involves increasing the size of operating teams (expected to double from 2019 to 2023 for top funds) and doing due diligences (DDs) holistically to cover operational and technological aspects.\\n\\nLooking forward, India remains a comparative bright spot, but PE-VC dealmaking is expected to remain tempered compared to 2021/2022 (amidst global macroeconomic uncertainties).

      "by them six decades later. Here are some examples of how \n",
      "we did so in 2023:\n",
      "• Since 2020, we’ve invested $1.5 billion in social and \n",
      "planetary impact. Working in the private, public, and \n",
      "social sectors, we’ve supported sustainable development \n",

      "• Over the past decade, BCGers have dedicated more \n",

      "and objectives. \n",
      "• In 2023, we completed more than 2,200 cases related to \n",
      "social and planetary impact for over 1,000 clients. \n",
      "• Among the largest companies we work with, 72% tackled \n",
      "at least one social or planetary impact project. \n",
      "• We were deeply involved in key global events aimed at \n",
      "driving social and environmental progress, such as the \n",
      "UN SDG Summit in New York and COP28 in Dubai.\n",
      "• We’re helping our clients implement reductions of more \n",

      "Challenge\n",
      "The BCGers in our Amsterdam office love to eat in the \n",
      "office canteen. But food choice has a large role to play in \n",
      "protecting the planet. Besides contributing significantly to \n",
      "global carbon emissions, agriculture can exert pressure on \n",
      "other parts of the ecosystem, such as the water supply. \n",
      "With these considerations in mind, the Green Team in \n",
      "Amsterdam asked, “Can we still eat great food but \n",
      "manage the impact on the planet?”\n",
      "Green Team Contribution\n",
      "The Green Team knew the power of “status quo bias”—\n",
      "people’s tendency to accept the default option. So they set \n",
      "about making Amsterdam office canteen meals vegetarian \n",
      "by default.\n",
      "Change isn’t easy. The team had to empathize with all the \n",
      "office’s stakeholders—including the cooks and the \n",
      "receptionists who ordered the ingredients—and it also \n",
      "learned that lacking animal protein doesn’t automatically \n",
      "make a food more sustainable overall. Much depends on \n",
      "the use of sustainable agriculture. Nevertheless, the \n",
      "Amsterdam Green Team gained traction through veggie \n",
      "cooking classes for the cooks, fun communication \n",
      "materials, and direct connection with suppliers. Eventually, \n",
      "these efforts helped the team receive final approval from \n",
      "the office lead.\n",
      "Potential Unlocked\n",
      "On September 1, 2023, Amsterdam’s canteen meal \n",
      "went vegetarian by default, although people could \n",
      "still order meat-based meals if they wished, thereby \n",
      "ensuring inclusivity.\n",
      "Assuming conservatively that they will reduce meat \n",
      "consumption by 75% each year, which amounts to a savings \n",
      "of around 1,000 kg, the Green Team estimates that the \n",
      "office will achieve a GHG reduction of about 50 metric tons \n",
      "of CO2e annually. Although that is a local, office-size impact, \n",
      "the team is proud of its contribution to SDG 6 (Clean Water \n",
      "and Sanitation) and SDG 13 (Climate Action). Furthermore, \n",
      "the team shared its story during a Green Team townhall, \n",
      "inspiring others and helping make sustainability the norm at \n",

Good food provides energy, enhances health and brings enjoyment. Yet, because of economic pressures, extreme weather events, supply disruptions and other challenges, many people around the world are struggling to obtain good nutrition. Our company is dedicated to doing its part to help create sustainable, resilient food systems so that people everywhere have access to affordable, good food – today and tomorrow.\\n\\nWith a broad portfolio of products that touch people’s lives at every stage, during every moment of the day, Nestlé holds a unique opportunity with consumers. From pre-conception and pregnancy to infancy and early childhood through to adulthood and old age, we offer nutrition, health and wellness products for everyone, ranging from Materna prenatal support for women to Yiyang functional milk for healthy longevity. We provide beloved beverages to people of all ages, such as Nido growing-up milks, Milo for active children and Nescafé for busy adults. And for those cherished cats and dogs, our Purina business aims to maximize every joyful moment.\\n\\n# Setting clear priorities\\n\\nThroughout our more than 150-year history, we have remained true to our purpose and values, even as we evolve to address changing consumer needs and new challenges. Moving forward, Nestlé aims to reinforce its position as a dependable, reliable company that consistently creates value for all stakeholders. Our top priorities are increasing consumer and customer preference for our products and expanding our market share.\\n\\nTo achieve these goals, we must make consumer-focused investments in our business. We strive to create efficiencies to fund those investments that enable us to succeed in the marketplace, thereby driving profitable growth. We call this continuous process the Nestlé Virtuous Circle. Our focus is execution excellence and, to that end, we prioritize quality, safety, simplicity, speed and agility.\\n\\n# Playing to our strengths\\n\\nNestlé has unparalleled strengths, with our iconic brands, global presence, unmatched local knowledge, unique in-market execution capabilities, R&D expertise and exceptional people.

With short, integrated supply chains, we are close to consumers, our partners and the farmers that provide our raw materials.

We provide micronutrient fortification with powdered milks from Bear Brand and Nido. We also develop new affordable protein options like Maggi Rindecarne, which provides a mix of soy and spices that doubles the amount of protein servings when combined with meat.\\n- New flavors and textures: People and pets increasingly want to enjoy new and elevated food experiences. With Purina Gourmet Revelations, for instance, cats can enjoy a variety of recipes in a pyramid-shaped delicate mousse covered with a tasty sauce.\\n- Modern cooking: Taking advantage of the increasing popularity of air fryers, we have launched several products across different geographies, including air fryer seasonings by Maggi and Totole as well as Stouffer’s Melt-FULLS frozen sandwiches.\\n\\n# Delivering tasty and balanced diets.\\n\\nIn line with our Nutrition, Health and Wellness strategy, we are committed to helping people enjoy tasty, balanced diets. Through our innovation and renovation efforts, we continue to reduce sugars, salt and saturated fats. At the same time, we know that people consume food and beverages not only for nutrition but also for enjoyment. Nestlé aims to offer the right products for these occasions as part of a balanced diet and provides on-pack portion guidance.\\n\\nWe are committed to growing the nutritional value of our global portfolio and we provide complete transparency. In 2024, Nestlé products with a Health Star Rating (HSR) of 3.5 stars or more – together with specialized nutrition products, such as baby foods, vitamin and mineral supplements, and medical nutrition – accounted for close to 59% of our food (excluding pet food) and beverage sales.\\n\\n# End-to-end digitalization.\\n\\nWe are accelerating our digital agenda to become a more intelligent enterprise from end to end – connected from farm to fork – empowered by real-time data and artificial intelligence (AI). We want data to be transmitted across our entire value chain so that we can react faster in our decisions about procurement, manufacturing and distribution – avoiding wasteful spending and lost opportunities. To optimize our digital investments, we are also upskilling our people to take full advantage of new technologies.\\n\\nOur digital transformation will support enterprise business planning by providing consistent, real-time data across all functions, which will help to improve forecasting accuracy. Our Brazilian market, for example, already has the end-to-end connectivity we strive for globally. Using predictive sales analytics, the Brazil team can predict the sell-out of a product over a 12-week period with 94% accuracy. More accurate forecasting enables us to quickly intervene if we see a gap, for example, by ramping up supply or production.\\n\\nIt helps us to better predict changes in the market and recognize consumer needs faster. With this data we can also offer the right promotions at the right time, tailor our communication to different consumer groups and target them on the channels they use most.\\n\\n# Protecting climate and resources.\\n\\nInvestments to enhance the resilience of our food producers and stabilize food systems are essential to ensuring the long-term success of our business. We continue our journey towards net zero emissions while being mindful of natural resources. Protecting our access to high-quality raw materials in sufficient quantities through regenerative practices helps drive competitive advantages.\\n\\nIn 2024, Nestlé achieved a 20.38% net reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions versus 2018 baseline, meeting one year ahead of time Nestlé Net Zero SBTi milestone of 20% by 2025. Reductions are due to the decarbonization of our own operations and our raw materials. We increased our use of renewable energy and improved the agricultural practices within our supply chains. We are actively pursuing further reductions to reach our goal of a 50% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030. We want all our raw materials to be traceable to the point of origin and farmed using methods aligned to our Responsible Sourcing Core Requirements, delivering benefits to people, nature and climate. In 2024, 44.5% of 14 priority raw materials were responsibly sourced as outlined by the requirements in our Nestlé Responsible Sourcing Framework.\\n\\n# Driving market share gains\\n\\nWith a focused portfolio of attractive categories, strong brands and innovative products, we want to grow our market share in all the markets where we are present. Following reduced investment in marketing during the pandemic, we are stepping up our marketing spend.\\n\\n# Executing with excellence.\\n\\nOne of our biggest strengths is that we have superior in-market knowledge and capabilities.

Delivering profitable growth\\n\\nInvestment in advertising and marketing is being stepped up to 9% of sales by the end of 2025 to support growth. Our long-term value creation model is based on the balanced pursuit of top- and bottom-line growth as well as improved capital efficiency. We create value guided by three strategic pillars:\\n\\n- Operational efficiency\\n- Resource and capital allocation with clear priorities\\n- Growth through efficiencies and continuous investment\\n\\nNestlé’s content engine also supports online sales. Our e-commerce sales continue to grow, now accounting for more than 25% of our total sales in eight markets, including our top two markets: the United States and China. Through the Nestlé Virtuous Circle, we free up resources to invest in our products and brands. Growth is the primary driver of value creation. Nestlé is taking action to deliver superior, sustainable and profitable growth. In the medium term, organic growth is expected to be 4% plus in a normal operating environment, with an underlying trading operating profit margin of 17.0% plus.\\n\\n# High standards of food safety and quality\\n\\nHigh standards of food safety and quality are fundamental in our engagement with consumers. Without them, gaining market share is impossible. Quality is embedded in our purpose and values – integral to our Corporate Business Principles. Our end-to-end approach to food safety and quality applies to design, delivery and consumption. We apply international standards, and help raise the bar in our industry using rigorous processes and leading scientific techniques. We update our food safety and quality systems to respond to changes, such as revised regulations, changes to suppliers or ingredients, introduction of regenerative agriculture practices, new packaging and geopolitical developments.\\n\\n12 Nestlé – Annual Review 2024', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='043b588d-6209-497b-adae-b3edb2881c3e', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'src\\\\input\\\\annual-review-2024-en.pdf', 'file_name': 'annual-review-2024-en.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 12302024, 'creation_date': '2025-03-16', 'last_modified_date': '2025-03-16'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='# Satisfying the growing demand for cold coffee\\n\\nCold coffee is increasingly the coffee drink of choice, especially among Gen Z and Millennials.

This past year we were pleased to announce the development of a breakthrough method that reduces fat in milk powders while increasing creaminess. Key to this innovation is the controlled aggregation of milk proteins, where the texture, viscosity and mouthfeel of milk fat is mimicked by protein. This leads to lower calorie levels but with the same taste and creaminess profile as a full-fat milk.\\n\\nWe continuously leverage our nutrition science and product development expertise to offer nutritious options without compromising on taste and texture. In particular, we look for ways to reduce added sugars, sodium and saturated fat, while providing positive nutrients. The new technology is an important milestone in Nestlé’s journey to offer healthier options without compromising on taste. It was successfully implemented in the Nido Brazil portfolio: Ninho Adulto, Ninho Proteen and Ninho School Age.

Additionally, actions taken to reduce customer inventory in the second half of the year reduced full-year RIG by approximately 20 basis points.\\n\\nBy geography, organic growth was driven by emerging markets and Europe, which together more than offset a decrease in North America. In developed markets, organic growth was 1.2%, with positive pricing and RIG. In emerging markets, organic growth was 3.7%, led by pricing with positive RIG.\\n\\n# Organic growth by product category\\n\\n- Coffee was the largest growth contributor with mid single-digit growth, supported by the three leading coffee brands: Nescafé, Nespresso and Starbucks.\\n- Sales in confectionery grew at a mid single-digit rate, led by KitKat and key local brands.\\n- PetCare delivered low single-digit growth, driven by continued momentum for science-based premium brands Purina ProPlan, Purina ONE and Friskies.\\n- Nestlé Health Science achieved mid single-digit growth, with double-digit growth in the second half of the year.\\n- Water reported low single-digit growth, with solid growth for S.Pellegrino and supported by the successful launch of Maison Perrier.\\n- Infant Nutrition sales grew at a low single-digit rate, supported by continued momentum for NAN and Lactogen.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='97499ca3-0214-4270-a787-af1ce8c58f02', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'src\\\\input\\\\annual-review-2024-en.pdf', 'file_name': 'annual-review-2024-en.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 12302024, 'creation_date': '2025-03-16', 'last_modified_date': '2025-03-16'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='# Sales by geographic area\\n\\nDifferences 2024/2023 (in %)\\n\\n|By principal markets|in CHF|in local currency|millions|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|North America|– 1.3%| |32 123|\\n|United States|– 1.2%|+ 0.8%|29 682|\\n|Canada|– 3.1%|+ 0.3%|2 441|\\n|Europe|– 0.9%|(a)|22 086|\\n|United Kingdom|+ 2.5%|+ 1.7%|3 617|\\n|France|– 3.1%|– 1.1%|3 437|\\n|Germany|– 9.2%|– 7.4%|2 008|\\n|Other markets of geographic area|+ 0.1%|(a)|13 024|\\n|of which Switzerland|– 3.5%|– 3.5%|1 062|\\n|Asia, Oceania and Africa|– 3.5%|(a)|19 180|\\n|Philippines|– 0.1%|+ 4.9%|2 674|\\n|India|+ 1.0%|+ 4.4%|2 013|\\n|Australia|+ 1.3%|+ 4.0%|1 469|\\n|Other markets of geographic area|– 5.3%|(a)|13 024|\\n|Latin America|– 1.8%|(a)|12 533|\\n|Brazil|– 2.2%|+ 7.6%|4 040|\\n|Mexico|– 2.5%|+ 2.8%|3 839|\\n|Chile|– 13.3%|– 0.6%|1 137|\\n|Other markets of geographic area|+ 4.1%|(a)|3 517|\\n|Greater China|– 1.7%|(a)|5 432|\\n|Total|– 1.8%|(a)|91 354|\\n\\n(a) Not applicable.\\n\\nNestlé – Annual Review 2024', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='af44c973-2b1d-403a-81f2-d4b76957dfe1', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'src\\\\input\\\\annual-review-2024-en.pdf', 'file_name': 'annual-review-2024-en.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 12302024, 'creation_date': '2025-03-16', 'last_modified_date': '2025-03-16'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='# Gross profit and operating profit\\n\\nGross profit was flat at CHF 42.7 billion, and the gross profit margin increased by 80 basis points to 46.7%.

We strive to create long-term value through a balance of sustainable growth and resource efficiency. Our culture and values – rooted in respect for ourselves, others, diversity and the future – guide our decisions and actions. Our Creating Shared Value approach helps us prioritize those areas that maximize value creation for shareholders and cultivate positive societal and environmental impacts.\\n\\nThe Nestlé Group Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework is designed to assess and mitigate risks in order to minimize their potential impact and support the achievement of Nestlé’s long-term purpose and business strategy. A top-down assessment is performed at Group-level once a year. A bottom-up assessment occurs in parallel, resulting in aggregation of the individual market assessments. This creates a good understanding of the company’s key risks in order to allocate ownership to drive specific actions around them and take any relevant steps to address them.\\n\\nAdditionally, Nestlé engages with external stakeholders to better understand the issues that are of most concern to them. A materiality assessment (detailed in the Non-Financial Statement) helps us to focus on sustainability impacts, risks and opportunities that are most relevant to both Nestlé and our stakeholders. This helps to ensure that wider sustainability issues are incorporated into the risks and opportunities under consideration across the company.\\n\\nRisk assessments and any mitigating actions are the responsibility of the individual line management. If Group-level intervention is required, responsibility for mitigating actions will generally be determined by the Executive Board. The annual Group risk assessment is reported annually to the Executive Board, Audit Committee and Board of Directors. Under the Group’s governance, the full Board is responsible for risk oversight. Further details of the ERM processes can be found in the Corporate Governance Report.\\n\\nWe are committed to transparency and action on climate-related risks and opportunities. We have aligned our reporting disclosures with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which can be found in our Non-Financial Statement.\\n\\n48 Nestlé

In 2024, we submitted for the first time our report on non-financial matters to an annual vote by shareholders as required by Swiss law. The vote in 2025 will be on our 2024 Non-Financial Statement prepared in anticipation of our future obligation to comply with the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).
