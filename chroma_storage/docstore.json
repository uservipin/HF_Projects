We continue to live \nby them six decades later. Here are some examples of how \nwe did so in 2023:\n\u2022 Since 2020, we\u2019ve invested $1.5 billion in social and \nplanetary impact. Working in the private, public, and \nsocial sectors, we\u2019ve supported sustainable development \nthrough pro bono and financial support.\n\u2022 Over the past decade, BCGers have dedicated more \nthan 1 million hours to a broad range of social projects \nand objectives. \n\u2022 In 2023, we completed more than 2,200 cases related to \nsocial and planetary impact for over 1,000 clients. \n\u2022 Among the largest companies we work with, 72% tackled \nat least one social or planetary impact project. \n\u2022 We were deeply involved in key global events aimed at \ndriving social and environmental progress, such as the \nUN SDG Summit in New York and COP28 in Dubai.\n\u2022 We\u2019re helping our clients implement reductions of more \nthan 1 gigaton of CO2 emissions by 2030\u2014equivalent to \nthe annual combined emissions of Germany and the UK.\nChristoph Schweizer \nChief Executive Officer \n(CEO) \nDavid Webb \nChief Sustainability Officer \n(CSO) \nWalking the Talk \nAlthough we measure our success by the positive impact of \nour clients and partners, we also commit to excellence in \nhow we operate as a firm. That means taking care of our \npeople, investing in the communities where we work and \nlive, and protecting our planet. \nBy the end of 2023, our headcount numbered 32,000\u2014 \nan increase of more than 6% over the prior year. Attracting \nand retaining top talent is one of our highest priorities. \nCentral to that effort is dedication to diversity, equity, and \ninclusion. In 2023, women made up 47% of our global \nworkforce and 39% of our Executive Committee. And in \nthe US, 44% of our people and 55% of our new hires were \nfrom racial or ethnic minority groups. \nOur internal climate goals remained front and center in 2023, \nand we\u2019ve stayed on track. Despite a rebound in business \ntravel after the pandemic, our 2023 emissions intensity fell \n59% compared with our baseline in 2018. And while the \nfocus of our net zero agenda is to reduce emissions intensity, \nwe also purchased high-quality carbon credits equivalent to \nthe volume of our unabated emissions.\nWe have committed to invest in breakthrough technologies \nthat are necessary for the world to reach net zero. Last \nyear, we invested in high-permanence direct air capture \ntechnology, as well as sustainable aviation fuel\u2014both \nnascent climate technologies that are vital paving stones \non the road to net zero.\nToward a Sustainable Future\nThe firm increased both its revenue and its impact in \n2023, unlocking the potential of more clients than ever \nbefore. We\u2019re proud of how we\u2019ve nurtured a culture \namong our people and our clients that continues to allow \nus to reach our goals. And we look forward to continuing \nthat push toward more sustainable business and a more \nsustainable world. \nWatch Christoph Schweizer introduce  \nBCG\u2019s 2023 Sustainability Report", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3302, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "718de732-b8ae-4071-9aba-9b2575b4d532": {"__data__": {"id_": "718de732-b8ae-4071-9aba-9b2575b4d532", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\Ai\\OneDrive\\Programm\\GitHub\\HF_Projects\\src\\input\\PDF\\2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 23435861, "creation_date": "2025-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c0a88343-199e-4456-a2ff-42260e7eea8c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\Ai\\OneDrive\\Programm\\GitHub\\HF_Projects\\src\\input\\PDF\\2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 23435861, "creation_date": "2025-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-17"}, "hash": "3d56b46342d58e584d1fe85261525ee59687b778d186e17a117fec2a93f1f341", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP INTRODUCTION  |  2023 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT       5\nW\nelcome to Boston Consulting Group\u2019s Annual \nSustainability Report.

For that reason, BCG deals with the most \nmaterial issues identified through our materiality assessment \nwithin our global enterprise risk management (ERM) process. \nOur chief risk officer, Adam Farber, oversees ERM\u2014an \narrangement that helps ensure that both materiality and risk \ncontribute to decision making and strategy. The reverse is \nalso true: our strategy can inform both materiality and risk \nmanagement. To learn more about risk management, see \npage 86.\nWe continue to advance our methods every year, and in \n2023 we enhanced our approach to materiality. Crucially, \nwe calibrated the risk appetite framework applied in ERM \nprocesses with the way we assess the risk and opportunity \nof each material topic. This shared language permits us to \nquantify materiality results in a way that we can seamlessly \nintegrate into our ERM assessments. As a result, we can \nmore easily manage material topics such as social impact, \nclimate action, and corporate culture alongside other risks \nand opportunities.\nBCG conducted a double materiality assessment (DMA) in \n2023 in which we considered not only the impact that ESG \ntopics might have on our business but the impact our \nbusiness can have on ESG topics, including human rights.\nAs in previous years, we aligned our methodology with \nthose of GRI, TCFD, and WEF. And although we are not \nobligated to adhere to the European Corporate \nSustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) this year, our  \nDMA methodology has made strides toward aligning with \nthe CSRD framework. This does not, however, signify full \nharmony with the directive\u2019s standards. To ensure accuracy \nand relevance, we validated our initial results with our \nstakeholders, using database-driven analysis, surveys, and \ndirect interviews of key stakeholders. We also tried to \nensure that the sample of stakeholders we consulted was \nrepresentative at the global level.\nOur DMA steering committee, which included the CSO and \nmembers of BCG\u2019s Audit and Risk Committee, approved \nthe DMA. We acknowledge that our potential positive \nimpact extends to the services that we provide to \nstakeholders to advance their climate, responsible AI, and \nsocial impact capabilities. We continue to actively manage \nimportant topics internally such as climate change, \ncorporate culture, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) \nvia our ERM program. \nWe acknowledge the value of receiving external assurance \non material topics. Although we are at the beginning of this \njourney, we have again received limited assurance for one \nhighly material topic: internal climate action. (See page 51.)\nBCG recognizes that visualization of DMAs will undoubtedly \nevolve in coming years. Nevertheless, we present our results \nbelow with a familiar two-axis diagram. (See Exhibit 1.)

In this chapter, we \ntell our story through the lens of the SDG accelerators we \nhave helped to unlock:\n\u2022 A digital revolution that leaves no one behind\n\u2022 Local collaboration for global impact\n\u2022 The power of the private sector\n\u2022 Getting creative to close financing gaps\n\u2022 Proactive adaptation and resilience\nWe address environmental topics, such as combating \nclimate change and protecting natural habitats, in the \n\u201cProtecting Our Planet\u201d chapter. There, we tell the story of \nhow we unlocked the climate and sustainability potential \nof our clients by focusing on six core areas:\n\u2022 Sustainable strategy and transformation\n\u2022 Decarbonization\n\u2022 Sustainable operations\n\u2022 Food and nature-based solutions\n\u2022 Green technology\n\u2022 Finance and investing\nAlthough cases that primarily drive social impact appear in \nthe \u201cDriving Social Impact\u201d chapter, and cases involving \nplanetary impact receive special attention in the \n\u201cProtecting Our Planet\u201d chapter, the holistic nature of \nsocietal impact means often results in overlap and \ncollaboration between the two. For that reason, the case \nstudies we present highlight both primary and secondary \ncontributions to SDGs.\nMaking a Measurable Impact\nBCG is committed to continually improving our transparency, \naccountability, and methods of impact measurement. Both \nthe qualitative information and the quantitative information \nprovided in this report are as accurate, up-to-date, clear, \nand reliable as possible. Our methods will evolve with best \npractice, but review by our own and external experts\u2014\nsometimes corroborated through third-party verification, \nhelps ensure that the data in this report is the product of \nrobust and rigorously applied methodologies.\nIn the \u201cDriving Social Impact\u201d chapter, our theory of \nchange guides our social impact teams. We have one goal \nin mind: to drive change that shapes a better future. We\u2019ve \ninvested in our ability to manage and measure impact. \nWith support from impact advisors at Value for Good, our \nimpact management team has created standardized \nmeasurement goals and criteria. \nValue for Good also provided the foundation for our newly \nlaunched Impact Academy, a platform to inform, engage, \nand upskill our social impact teams and the wider BCG \ncommunity. With impact at the core of all we do, we have \nestablished a culture based on integrity, open dialogue, \nand a learning mindset. Combined with a dedication to \nsystematic analysis, this helps ensure that our social \nimpact metrics are as accurate as possible now and are \nconstantly improving.\nFor the \u201cProtecting Our Planet\u201d chapter, we\u2019ve increased \nthe resources available to identify and measure the climate \naction that we achieve through client work. Combined with \nsimilar methodological rigor that our social impact teams \nemploy, this helps to ensure that the figures provided on \nprojects, clients, and other climate and sustainability \ninvestments are reliable and constantly advancing.\nMeanwhile, our most material environmental topic \ninternally involves our carbon emissions. For this reason, \nwe maintain a best-in-class global carbon accounting \nsystem that meets the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, \nand we independently verify our emissions against the ISO \n14064-3 standard. This has helped us earn inclusion on the \nCDP A List for three consecutive years. Also of note: in \n2023, our EcoVadis rating advanced from gold to platinum, \nplacing us in the top 1% of companies assessed.

BCG was a Principal \nStrategy and Action Partner to COP28, held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.\nAt COP28, we provided implementation support across environmental topics, including \nhydrogen, climate finance, decarbonization, food system transformation, and nature \nprotection. One example is our publication with IRENA and the Global Renewables \nAlliance, Tripling Renewable Power and Doubling Energy Efficiency by 2030: Crucial Steps \nTowards 1.5\u00b0C. This outlined enablers to triple global renewable power capacity to \n11,000 GW and double average annual energy efficiency improvements by 2030.\nWe also helped drive social impact by unlocking insight on adaptation and resilience. \nRelevant publications include \u201cAdaptation and Resilience Through Land Transport \nInfrastructure Systems\u201d to help communities impacted by climate change, the first \nannual Sharm-El-Sheikh Adaptation Agenda implementation report for COP28, and \nadaption and resilience needs across finance, planning, food and agriculture, and \nhuman settlements.

For that reason, we proudly reaffirm our \nenduring and substantial commitment to societal impact. \nIn 2023, BCG contributed $340 million to help solve the \nyear\u2019s most pressing social issues. We have now invested \nmore than $1 billion into driving social impact since 2020.\n2023 Highlights\nIn 2023, Social Impact and Climate & Sustainability \ncontinued to be two of our fastest-growing practices. Not \nincluding MDPs, 2,600 BCG employees used their expertise \nto drive social impact.\nWe also reached an important milestone in 2023: over the \npast decade, BCG has dedicated over 1 million hours to \nsupporting a broad range of social impact projects and \nobjectives across the globe. This figure includes pro bono work.\nIn a year of uncertainty, BCG stayed true to our belief that \nsocial impact is critical, regardless of the tenor of the \nbusiness cycle. We played a major role in convening the \nprivate, public, and social sectors to accelerate progress on \nthe SDGs. We continued to provide humanitarian support \nduring major crises, both manmade and natural.\nBy dedicating our time and resources alongside our clients \nand partners, we believe that we can help catalyze change \nwhere it is most needed and move SDG fulfillment from \naspiration to realization. In 2023, we identified six \naccelerators for progress on the SDGs:\n\u2022  A Digital Revolution That Leaves No One Behind. \nDigital technology and data have the potential to \nmeaningfully advance social impact efforts. \n\u2022 Local Collaboration for Global Impact. Collaboration \nis key, but it can sometimes proceed slowly. An approach \nthat emphasizes achieving a local impact first can help.\n\u2022 The Power of the Private Sector. The private sector \ncan advance progress while also improving competitive \nstrength.\n\u2022 Getting Creative to Close Financing Gaps. A \ncollective response from the financial ecosystem is \nessential to close critical gaps.\n\u2022 Working to Bridge Social Divides.

BCG \nsupported the development of the first NAP, working with a \nSoutheast Asian country that has extensive coastal exposure \nand is highly vulnerable to the impact of climate change.\nOver the past ten years, extreme climate events in the \ncountry have inflicted economic losses and damage \nequivalent to about twice the country\u2019s education budget. \nIt urgently needed to develop a climate adaptation and \nresilience strategy to safeguard its citizenry, ecosystems, \nand economy.\nBCG\u2019s Contribution \nBCG applied an integrated adaptation and resilience \napproach, powered by our Climate Impact AI, to develop a \nmultihazard, multisectoral NAP.

We expanded its portfolio \nto include more than 1,500 projects, an increase of more \nthan 50% since last year. In 2023, the practice worked with \n700 clients, up from 240 clients in 2020. We feel a sense of \naccomplishment working with our diverse clients to develop \nplans to radically reduce emissions, mitigate risk through \nadaptation and resilience, and support the sustainability of \nour natural resources and food systems. In 2023 alone, we \nworked with roughly 70% of top 100 Energy and Industrial \nGoods clients on climate and sustainability solutions, with \nsix core areas of focus Each focus area contributes to \naccelerating the achievement of the UN Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs).

The platform aims \nto accelerate and scale the adoption of these technologies \nworldwide and thereby reduce their \u201cgreen premiums.\u201d \nBCG was a founding partner of Breakthrough Energy Catalyst \nin 2021, and we continue to support its evaluation of new \ndecarbonization technologies and its efforts to understand \nhow best to remove barriers to their adoption. In 2023, we \nevaluated approximately 20 emerging climate technologies \n(including thermal energy storage, green cement, and H2 \npipeline infrastructure) to assess their GHG impact, their \nneed for catalytic funding, and their readiness to scale, as \nwell as to identify which ones Catalyst should prioritize for \ninvestments, ultimately leading the organization to add a \nnew technology to its scope. This work is critical to \nidentifying, funding, and scaling technology solutions that will \nenable the world to reach its climate targets. Together with \nBreakthrough Energy Catalyst and Third Way, an American \nthink tank, we published multiple reports and analyses on \nthe competitiveness of clean technology in the US.\nCDP\nBCG and CDP, the world\u2019s preeminent disclosure platform, \nhave a long-standing strategic partnership. We collaborate \non high-impact societal topics such as aligning the disclosure \nframework with the International Sustainability Standards \nBoard, building CDP\u2019s new global tech platform, and \nassessing which levers drive the greatest reduction in \nemissions. These joint efforts provide greater transparency \nabout what companies are doing to deliver on their climate \ntargets. We also partnered with CDP on efforts at New York \nClimate Week and COP28, as well as on initiatives that aim \nto enable talent upskilling and growth. In addition, we \npartner with CDP on thought leadership, yielding key \ninsights such as the power of supply chain decarbonization \n(supply chains generate 11 times the emissions of in-house \noperations on average). \nThe Power of Collective Action for \nPlanetary Impact\nA critical part of delivering impact on climate and \nsustainability lies in collective action through partnerships \nwith major multilateral organizations such as the UN, as well \nas in global initiatives such as Breakthrough Energy and the \nFirst Movers Coalition.\nIn supporting these partnerships, BCG draws on the full \nbreadth of its expertise to deliver holistic solutions to \ncomplex problems. To see how we help partners such as the \nUN, COP28, World Business Council for Sustainable \nDevelopment, and WEF move from bold ideas to exponential \nimpact, see page 12.\nAt the same time, our Climate & Sustainability practice \ncatalyzes and magnifies the progress of these partnerships \nin unique ways. These include pursuing efforts to protect \nbiodiversity, accelerate investment and innovation, and \nachieve a net zero future. When it comes to achieving \nprogress, we believe that there is strength in numbers. By \nworking together, we can break down barriers that are too \ndifficult or complex for any single organization to surmount. \nFor this reason, our partnerships are diverse: we work with \ngovernments, business associations, international NGOs, \nand other members of civil society to drive action on a range \nof solutions.

This statement, \nwhich we update each year, embodies our commitments \nand principles and affects the way BCG operates every day.\nTo execute the program, the Strat Co formed the  \nGlobal Internal Sustainability Team, whose mandate \nhas three pillars:\n\u2022 Measure. Set baselines for carbon accounting, and \nmonitor and disclose progress.\n\u2022 Reduce. Lower the firm\u2019s carbon emissions and other \nnegative environmental impacts.\n\u2022 Remove. Take away 100% of the emissions that we\u2019re \nunable to reduce by 2030, using the most effective \nnature-based and engineered carbon removal solutions. \nClimate change is the most material environmental topic \nfor BCG. That\u2019s why we have committed to achieving net \nzero climate impact by 2030 and to becoming climate \npositive thereafter, removing more carbon from the \natmosphere than we emit each year.\nWe follow the GHG mitigation hierarchy by first avoiding \nand reducing emissions within our value chain, and then \ncompensating for and neutralizing our remaining \nemissions. We have set validated near-term science-based \ntargets that aim to cut our GHG emissions intensity in half \nby 2025. Our targets align with the most ambitious goal of \nthe Paris Agreement: to limit global temperature rise to \n1.5\u00b0C above preindustrial levels. We have already \nsignificantly reduced our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions \nand have established a clear decarbonization plan for our \nScope 3 business travel emissions.\nIn addition to reducing our GHG emissions, we have, since \n2018, purchased and retired a volume of independently \nverified carbon credits equivalent to our remaining \nunabated emissions. As part of our journey toward net zero \nclimate impact, we will transition our carbon credit \nportfolio to 100% CDR credits by 2030. Our goals are to \nsupport high-quality nature-based solutions and to help \npioneer the most promising technological solutions, such \nas direct air capture (DAC) and storage.\nIn keeping with best practice, such as WWF\u2019s Blueprint, we \nhave quantified and publicly communicated the price we \nexpect to pay to reduce, avoid, and remove emissions as \nwe work toward net zero. We expect to pay a blended \ncarbon price of $35 per metric ton in 2025, rising to \napproximately $80 per metric ton by 2030.

We take an operational control approach to consolidating our carbon emissions inventory.\n9. Although CO2 is a significant and crucially long-lived pollutant from aviation, it represents only about 50% of the total warming caused by \nflying. Other emissions from aviation, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and particulate matter (PM), as well as indirect \nfactors such as the formation of contrails and clouds, contribute to effective radiative forcing (ERF). Following best practice, we account for \nthe non-GHG climate impact of aviation by multiplying the CO2 impact by 1.9, effectively doubling our flight emissions. We include non-\nGHG warming effects within our full reported GHG boundary. But in accordance with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) aviation \nsector guidance, we exclude them from our business travel target boundary. For the same travel target, we also include upstream well-to-\ntank emissions from the combustion of aviation fuel; however we do not include these in the full reported GHG inventory above. Please see \nTable 1 on page 96 of the appendix for a summary of our full GHG inventory and target boundaries.\nThe First Three Years of \nBCG\u2019s Net Zero Journey", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2773, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d0c0cb1-af05-4168-a819-394ad57fd55f": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d0c0cb1-af05-4168-a819-394ad57fd55f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\Ai\\OneDrive\\Programm\\GitHub\\HF_Projects\\src\\input\\PDF\\2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 23435861, "creation_date": "2025-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5d645923-6d9c-47c5-9913-0f82580aa161", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\Ai\\OneDrive\\Programm\\GitHub\\HF_Projects\\src\\input\\PDF\\2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 23435861, "creation_date": "2025-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-17"}, "hash": "b549ca0b8d5b8292bc4fed7cb240777a5109f52204ca482f3bdefd2fe8e75652", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP PROTECTING OUR PLANET  |  2023 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT       55\nCompared with our 2018 baseline, our 2023 emissions \nwere 27% lower in absolute terms and 59% lower on a \nper-person intensity basis. Compared with absolute \nemissions in 2022, our emissions in 2023 increased. The \nincrease in absolute emissions since 2023 is not surprising, \ngiven the continued rebound from two years of COVID-19, \nand we have accounted for it in our plans to achieve our \nemissions reduction targets. Moreover, as discussed in the \nnext section, we have taken concrete action to remain on \ntrack to achieve net zero climate impact by 2030.\nReducing Our Emissions Intensity\nTo achieve our goal of net zero emissions by 2030, we\u2019re \nfocusing on reducing our main source of emissions: \nbusiness travel. At BCG, as at many other firms in our \nindustry, business travel makes up about 80% of total \nemissions. We aim to cut emissions from business travel by \n48.5% per employee by 2025, compared with our 2018 \nlevels, setting one of the most ambitious targets in our \nsector. SBTi has validated this target, giving us confidence \nthat the goal is both bold and achievable.\nIn 2023, our emissions intensity from business travel \nwas 62% lower than in 2018. We achieved this reduction \nthrough a mix of strategies: approximately 50% from \naltering our travel habits and 12% from improvements in \nefficiencies.10 (See Exhibit 4.)\nExhibit 4 - Progress on BCG\u2019s Scope 3 Business Travel Science-Based Target\nTarget: Reduce Scope 3 business travel emissions by 48.5% per FTE by 2025 against the 2018 baseline year \n 20192018 2020 2021 2022 2023\n20\n0\n40\n60\n80\n100\nREDUCTION VERSUS 2018 (%)\nINCREMENTAL YEAR\n48.5\n82\n87\n60 62\nCOVID-19 restrictions imposed\nSBTi 2025 reduction target Progress versus target\n9\nSource: BCG analysis.\nNote: FTE = full-time equivalent employee.\nAs we continue to adapt our business model, we\u2019re finding \ninnovative ways to lower our travel-related emissions \nwithout compromising the quality of our client services, \nbuilding strong relationships, or altering our commitment \nto improving our employee experience. To meet our \nreduction target, members of a dedicated network of \nchange agents\u2014including managing directors and \npartners (MDPs) and business leaders from every region, \npractice, business unit, and function\u2014have helped develop \nemissions reduction plans tailored to their specific \ngeographic and business contexts. We are now \nimplementing these plans across our organization.\nThree years into our net zero commitment, we\u2019ve found \nthat achieving our goal requires a multifaceted approach. \nKey strategies include adopting purposeful co-location \npractices, rethinking how we organize events, enhancing \ntransparency and accountability, encouraging the use of \ngreener travel options, and supporting the use of SAF.\n10.

This adaptation helped us \nset clear yearly targets for regions, practices, and \nfunctions. Budget owners have begun deploying emissions \nreduction initiatives tailored to their specific contexts, \nallowing leaders to make tradeoffs to meet their objectives \nconsistently with BCG\u2019s goals. \nAccelerating the Adoption of Purposeful Co-location \nTeaming Models. We have updated our models for \nengagement and teaming so that we more purposefully \nco-locate and collaborate among teams and with clients. \nWe now actively involve our clients in defining a co-location \nmodel for our projects, which helps us reduce emissions, \nimprove productivity, increase flexibility, and maximize \nvalue creation. Furthermore, we are embedding client \nlocation as an additional factor influencing resourcing \ndecisions for our projects to minimize travel without \ncompromising on expertise and value creation. Finally, \nwe\u2019re promoting the option of weekend stays at client sites \nto reduce the number of trips taken during the project life \ncycle. This option offers carbon savings and an improved \nemployee experience.\nEvolving Our Approach to Internal Meetings and \nEvents. In addition to changing our approach to client \ntravel, we are committed to lowering our travel emissions \nfor internal meetings and events. For example, our \npractices are adapting the format, cadence, and location \nchoices for their meetings to lower emissions per \nparticipant. This has helped them stay within their carbon \nbudgets. We have also adopted a new model for some of \nour global and regional meetings and learning and \ndevelopment programs where new tools have helped \nplanners reduce emissions per attendee by approximately \n40% to 50%. To support this model, event organizers are \nusing a CO2 optimizer tool that enables them to quickly \nidentify the meeting location that will generate the lowest \nquantity of emissions, based on the attendees\u2019 location. \nCreating Transparency and Accountability for Travel \nEmissions. We have established internal reporting and \nmonitoring tools to provide transparency for each carbon \nbudget owner. Whether at the level of a region, practice, \nfunction, or business unit, all parts of the firm are \nprogressing toward their GHG emissions targets. Further, \nwe have deployed dashboards to enable all MDPs, \ndirectors, and business and project leaders to track their \nindividual and project travel emissions. The dashboards \nhelp them understand the underlying drivers of emissions \nand assess how theirs compare with those of their peers \nwithin BCG, encouraging greener travel decisions.\nComplementing these transparency instruments is a suite of \nplanning tools. For example, our case emissions calculator \nenables case leaders to quickly identify the most carbon-\nintensive cases and model different scenarios that will have \nless environmental impact. The aforementioned meeting \nlocation optimizer tool enables large-event planners to \nidentify the best location for a meeting on the basis of \nattendee location. This helps maximize participation while \nminimizing emissions and financial cost. With such \nspecialized tools, our teams can contribute to our net zero \ngoals without compromising other business priorities.\nPromoting Greener Travel Modes. Besides being prudent \nabout travel frequency, we promote greener travel modes \nwhenever possible. For example, where viable, we try to \nincrease the proportion of trips taken by train instead of \nairplane where available and appropriate. We are tracking \nthis shift, providing transparency, and nudging our colleagues \ntoward this behavior through our booking tools and policies.\nSupporting the Use of SAF. BCG has been an early \nmover in adopting SAF as a key component of our net zero \nstrategy. Our approach recognizes SAF\u2019s potential to reduce \njet fuel\u2019s life-cycle emissions by up to 100% compared with \nconventional jet fuel\u2014and acknowledges the need to \npartner with the industry to scale up supply. In 2023, with \ntravel emissions still on track to reach our 2025 target, we \nfocused on strengthening partnerships and contributing to \nthe development of an efficient SAF emissions reductions \nmarket. This included partnerships with accounting \nstandards and registries\u2014 in particular, through our \ninvolvement in the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance.\nBaku - Elyor", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4646, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cbd6ed94-0a2b-49ff-9895-81eacee62c27": {"__data__": {"id_": "cbd6ed94-0a2b-49ff-9895-81eacee62c27", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\Ai\\OneDrive\\Programm\\GitHub\\HF_Projects\\src\\input\\PDF\\2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 23435861, "creation_date": "2025-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "afdd63d4-0199-45f5-9323-abae74c57e1d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\Ai\\OneDrive\\Programm\\GitHub\\HF_Projects\\src\\input\\PDF\\2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 23435861, "creation_date": "2025-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-17"}, "hash": "11fc570d81d80bd4257f63d91f1af61353d0a82a9412e89f395cee3198d83cba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP PROTECTING OUR PLANET  |  2023 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT       57\nExhibit 5 - Progress on BCG\u2019s Scope 1 and Scope 2 Science-Based Target\nTarget: Reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 92% per FTE by 2025 against the 2018 baseline year \nDecarbonizing Our Direct Operations\nOur direct energy (Scope 1) and electricity (Scope 2) \nemissions are small relative to our Scope 3 GHG inventory. \nNevertheless, we have set a science-based target to reduce \nScope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 92% per FTE by 2025 \nversus our 2018 baseline year, which the SBTi has validated. \nIn pursuing this target, we have taken decisive action to \nreduce those emissions.\nIn 2023, our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity was \n95% lower than in our 2018 baseline year.

To maintain carbon neutrality in accordance with PAS2060 standards, we purchase and retire a volume of independently verified carbon credits \nequivalent to our full reported Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 GHG inventory (as enumerated in Exhibit 4). Our current portfolio is a mix of \navoided emissions credits and CO2 removal credits. \n13. In particular, we are in compliance with California\u2019s Voluntary Carbon Market Disclosures Act (AB 1305). We also disclose the pertaining entity, \nproject, carbon offset, protocol, and verification information for voluntary carbon offsets sold within California here.\n14. All of the carbon credits we purchased and retired in 2023 were independently verified against the leading voluntary standards (including the \nGold Standard and VCS), which have been approved by the International Carbon Reduction and Offset Alliance.\nNeutralizing Our Remaining Climate Impact\nIn 2023, continuing the approach we took in 2022, we \ninvested in high-quality carbon abatement solutions on the \nvoluntary carbon market. We focused on three objectives:\n\u2022 Make progress on our commitments of 100% carbon \ndioxide removal (CDR) and more than 100,000 tons of \ndurable CDR by 2030.\n\u2022 Continue working to ensure the integrity and quality of \ncredits, especially on nature-based solutions.\n\u2022 Scale up our support of DAC, leveraging BCG\u2019s full range \nof expertise. \nWhile doing all this, we sought to compensate for our \nannual emissions with a portfolio of independently verified \ncarbon credits that we purchased and retired.12 We \nachieved carbon neutrality in our business operations for \nthe period January 1 to December 31, 2023, in accordance \nwith PAS2060 requirements.\nWe believe that transparency is the key to scaling up high-\nquality solutions. With this as our guiding principle, we \ncomply with all relevant regulations and have an \nindependent third party verify all claims linked to BCG\u2019s net \nzero program.13 We also voluntarily disclose the carbon \ncredit type, quality, and blended cost of the credits we \npurchase. We hope that more and more buyers will follow a \nsimilar approach, thereby promoting a better-functioning \nvoluntary carbon market. For a detailed breakdown of our \ncarbon credit portfolio, see Exhibit 6.14  \n2023 Progress\nRealizing Our 2030 CDR Commitments. This year, we \nsuccessfully increased the share of CDR in our portfolio to \n52%, coming closer to our goal of achieving 100% CDR by \n2030 while also enhancing the quality of the projects we \nsupported, as discussed in the next section of the report. In \naddition, we strengthened our expertise and internal \ncapabilities in hybrid CDR pathways, such as biomass \ncarbon removal and storage (BiCRS) and biochar. This led \nto a tenfold increase in our CDR retirement from biochar to \nmore than 3,000 tons, both from the ramp-up of our \nexisting partnership with NetZero Biochar in Brazil and \nfrom a new agreement with Exomad Green in Bolivia. \nThese accomplishments are reflected in our average credit \nprice, which rose to $18 per ton of CO2 to avoid, reduce, \nand remove our emissions.\nBeyond increasing our durable removals purchases for 2023, \nwe built a strong pipeline of deals in the durable CDR space, \nhelping us to progress toward our FMC commitment to \npurchase 100,000 tons of durable removals by 2030. In \nparticular, we signed large DAC and storage deals (as noted \nin the previous section) and welcomed NextGen\u2019s inaugural \ncontracts with 1PointFive (for DAC), CarboCulture (for \nbiochar), and Summit Carbon Solutions (for BiCRS), \nexpecting first deliveries by 2025.

Although the market \nbegan paying increasing attention to DAC in 2023, we \nnoticed a gap in the understanding of the technology\u2019s \nlong-term potential and associated tradeoffs\u2014a gap that \nwas preventing the ecosystem from scaling. We reflected \non how BCG could best help shift this paradigm, leading to \ntwo key BCG initiatives in 2023. \nFirst, we gathered expertise from all across BCG, from \nDAC technology experts to carbon markets specialists, and \npublished an in-depth cost analysis and call to action. We \nconcluded that although the technology is very high-cost \ntoday at its very small scale, it has strong potential to move \ndown the cost curve to $150 to $200 per ton of CO2e. If \nit achieves removal costs in this range, DAC could play a \ncritical role in efforts to reach global net zero, offering \nscalable, permanent, and verifiable CO2 removal. We \nidentified actions that suppliers, standards, companies, and \ngovernments should take to unlock the potential of DAC to \noperate at much lower cost and at the scale of gigatons. \nWe found that a key lever from buyers is the existence \nof early adopters willing and able to support nascent \ntechnologies and thus provide the required catalytic \nimpact. This finding corroborated our preexisting carbon \nremoval strategy.\nSecond, we built a diversified DAC portfolio for our own \nfootprint, signed a 15-year partnership with Climeworks, \nand developed new collaborations with 1PointFive and \nCarbonCapture Inc. (See Exhibit 6.)\nEspecially for DAC, we engage with our clients to drive \nCDR innovation. This means directly supporting clean tech \ndevelopers, but also helping clients to decarbonize and \nestablish a CDR portfolio.

To deal with the localized, \noffice-specific nature of these topics, our Global Internal \nSustainability Team enlists support from teams that \noperate at a local level, including real estate, procurement, \nand Green Teams.\nSelecting Sustainable Offices\nOur offices are a key contributor to our environmental \nfootprint. By improving energy efficiency, switching to \nrenewable power, and minimizing our waste and our water \nconsumption, we are making our offices more sustainable \nworldwide. We target the highest environmental standards \nfor new offices and major renovations, and more than 45 of \nour offices now hold a formal green building certification, \nsuch as LEED Platinum or BREEAM. To support \nsustainable decisions across all BCG offices, we partnered \nwith a specialist sustainability firm to develop BCG\u2019s green \noffice selection and fit-out standards, which cover a wide \nrange of environmental topics, from energy and water use \nto selecting more sustainable office furniture.\nParis When It\u2019s Sustainable\nIn 2023, our relocation of BCG\u2019s Paris office to 75 Avenue \nde la Grande Arm\u00e9e demonstrated our commitment to \nimproving the environmental and social sustainability of \nour offices. The carbon-efficient redevelopment of the \n\u201cL1ve\u201d building, originally built in the 1960s, was a key \nconsideration in the selection process, complemented \nby its achievement of prestigious green-building \ncertifications such as HQE Excellent, LEED Gold, and \nWELL Gold. \nThe renovation\u2019s ambitious circular economy approach\u2014\nwhich avoided 394 metric tons of CO2 emissions by reusing \nmore than 81 metric tons of materials from the existing \nbuilding structure and fa\u00e7ade\u2014along with features such as \nrenewable energy rooftop solar panels and a geothermal \nsystem, demonstrated that the renovator\u2019s mission \nmatched ours.\nAccess to biodiversity-friendly terraces, an interior garden, \nbike storage, and nearby public transport further aligned \nwith our environmental vision, while also promoting \nemployee well-being and community engagement. By \nintegrating BCG\u2019s sustainable office fit-out standards and \nincorporating an array of work and communal spaces, \ntogether with wellness-focused and inclusive facilities, we \nhelped foster a healthy and equitable work environment \nthat supports the needs of our diverse workforce.\nCollectively, these actions not only align with SDG 7 \n(Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and \nSDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), but also \nsupport SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), reflecting our \nholistic approach to environmental and social responsibility.\nClosing the Loop on Waste\nAcross our offices and operations, we aim to embed the \nprinciples of the waste hierarchy (avoid, reduce, reuse, and \nrecycle). For example, we avoid and reduce paper \nconsumption by applying paperless office principles, and \nwe increase rates of general office waste recycling by \ninstalling recycling facilities for all major waste streams \nacross all offices, to the extent possible. For our most \nmaterial waste streams, such as electronic waste, we \npartner with specialist companies that reuse components \nto extend their life cycle and ensure proper recycling for all \nnonreusable components. Owing to our relatively low \nvolumes of waste generation, we do not currently report \ntotal waste volumes or set formal targets on this topic. \nEngaging Our Employees in Our Climate Journey\nWe educate all employees and raise their awareness of \nclimate and environmental issues, in addition to identifying \nactions that they can take to contribute to BCG\u2019s net zero \ncommitment. To complement the broad range of online \nand in-person learning events that we host, we support \nlocal action through our global network of Green Teams, \nwhich has grown to more than 1,500 active members. \nDistributed across our BCG locations, these teams focus on \ndesigning and implementing initiatives to reduce our \nenvironmental impact at the local office level.

But food choice has a large role to play in \nprotecting the planet. Besides contributing significantly to \nglobal carbon emissions, agriculture can exert pressure on \nother parts of the ecosystem, such as the water supply. \nWith these considerations in mind, the Green Team in \nAmsterdam asked, \u201cCan we still eat great food but \nmanage the impact on the planet?\u201d\nGreen Team Contribution\nThe Green Team knew the power of \u201cstatus quo bias\u201d\u2014\npeople\u2019s tendency to accept the default option. So they set \nabout making Amsterdam office canteen meals vegetarian \nby default.\nChange isn\u2019t easy. The team had to empathize with all the \noffice\u2019s stakeholders\u2014including the cooks and the \nreceptionists who ordered the ingredients\u2014and it also \nlearned that lacking animal protein doesn\u2019t automatically \nmake a food more sustainable overall. Much depends on \nthe use of sustainable agriculture. Nevertheless, the \nAmsterdam Green Team gained traction through veggie \ncooking classes for the cooks, fun communication \nmaterials, and direct connection with suppliers. Eventually, \nthese efforts helped the team receive final approval from \nthe office lead.\nPotential Unlocked\nOn September 1, 2023, Amsterdam\u2019s canteen meal \nwent vegetarian by default, although people could \nstill order meat-based meals if they wished, thereby \nensuring inclusivity.\nAssuming conservatively that they will reduce meat \nconsumption by 75% each year, which amounts to a savings \nof around 1,000 kg, the Green Team estimates that the \noffice will achieve a GHG reduction of about 50 metric tons \nof CO2e annually. Although that is a local, office-size impact, \nthe team is proud of its contribution to SDG 6 (Clean Water \nand Sanitation) and SDG 13 (Climate Action). Furthermore, \nthe team shared its story during a Green Team townhall, \ninspiring others and helping make sustainability the norm at \nBCG. As sustainability becomes embedded in our culture, \nwe hope to see positive spillover effects across the rest of \nour decision making and operations.\nBOSTON CONSULTING GROUP PROTECTING OUR PLANET  |  2023 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT       61", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2250, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b786f64-ccab-4236-92b4-96dd67d822d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b786f64-ccab-4236-92b4-96dd67d822d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\Ai\\OneDrive\\Programm\\GitHub\\HF_Projects\\src\\input\\PDF\\2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 23435861, "creation_date": "2025-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8e746411-dc7e-4fd8-b973-676e4dfb283a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\Ai\\OneDrive\\Programm\\GitHub\\HF_Projects\\src\\input\\PDF\\2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 23435861, "creation_date": "2025-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-17"}, "hash": "e62e843b2b8339e30dbe1a7f8c16c006ee8b9ae2687e5e11392f6ef9a5d7b87f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP EMPOWERING OUR PEOPLE  |  2023 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT       62\nEmpowering Our People\n2023 in Numbers \n39%\n44%\nour global headcount, \na year-over-year \nincrease of more \nthan 6%\n32K\nof employees have \naccess to health and \nwell-being support \nservices\n100%\nof employees have \naccess to personalized \ncareer development \nopportunities\n100%\nonline learning \nhours logged by BCG \nemployees\n1.2M\n55%\nRacial or ethnic group representation in the US Women representation\nNew hiresHeadcount\nGlobal headcount\nExecutive \nCommittee\nJohannesburg - Isme and Londani\nINTRODUCTION     DRIVING SOCIAL IMPACT     PROTECTING OUR PLANET    EMPOWERING OUR PEOPLE     PROMOTING RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS PRACTICES     APPENDIX  \n47%\nAttracting the best and most diverse talent", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 780, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5d183903-7ed8-4102-ac56-4c3a6b6ec624": {"__data__": {"id_": "5d183903-7ed8-4102-ac56-4c3a6b6ec624", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\Ai\\OneDrive\\Programm\\GitHub\\HF_Projects\\src\\input\\PDF\\2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 23435861, "creation_date": "2025-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4bb7e7e9-7369-4f75-8ee5-76f3c4e31458", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\Ai\\OneDrive\\Programm\\GitHub\\HF_Projects\\src\\input\\PDF\\2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 23435861, "creation_date": "2025-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-17"}, "hash": "502d4dde00ffffc242539233ad83fc98acd395dfbd544340fae57c35682a174d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP EMPOWERING OUR PEOPLE  |  2023 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT       63\nO\nur dedication to fostering an environment \nwhere every individual can thrive is rooted in our \ncommitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. \nBCG aims not only to attract the brightest minds from a \nmultitude of backgrounds, but also to nurture their talent.\nIn 2023, we continued to unlock the potential of our \npeople.

BCG also works through career and campus \nprograms and partnerships to ensure that candidates from \nunderrepresented backgrounds have the opportunity to \nlearn about and prepare for a career in consulting. \nIn addition, BCG provides global messaging guidelines \nand ongoing unconscious-bias training for our interviewers \nand recruiters. We outline the recruiting process to our \ncandidates at the beginning of the journey and provide \nfeedback along the way. We also give them opportunities to \nlearn about our culture through experience programs and by \nmeeting BCGers, helping them make an informed decision.\nParis - Consulting team", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2538, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3d87ffa-31dc-4923-8186-900cfb0e1f0a": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3d87ffa-31dc-4923-8186-900cfb0e1f0a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\Ai\\OneDrive\\Programm\\GitHub\\HF_Projects\\src\\input\\PDF\\2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 23435861, "creation_date": "2025-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe5e2585-c33a-4f5b-9b9c-c8026e6d8808", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\Ai\\OneDrive\\Programm\\GitHub\\HF_Projects\\src\\input\\PDF\\2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 23435861, "creation_date": "2025-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-17"}, "hash": "9f9a35f5c35ebea17a7687295b0fcbe429ee7237dd42bb7f2665eb1f6000c6fb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP EMPOWERING OUR PEOPLE  |  2023 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT       64\nProviding a High-Quality Experience for Candidates \nWe engage candidates with highly personalized content. \nWe offer an innovative candidate experience through \nvirtual tools that broaden BCG\u2019s reach in the market, \nencourage diverse candidate pipelines, maximize cost and \nrecruitment efficiencies, minimize our carbon footprint, \nand yield sustainable headcount growth.

At the core of these initiatives \nis a robust culture of participation and active listening that \nextends across the firm.\nWe conduct a People Survey that gives employees an \nopportunity to provide feedback on their experiences. \nBecause we conduct the survey annually, we can track \nprogress over time and ensure that we are acting on the \nfeedback received. As appropriate, we supplement the \nPeople Survey with an additional, shorter survey that \nenables us to quickly take the pulse of employees on topics \nthat may be top of mind for them and to react to any \nconcerns or suggestions raised. Another valuable forum is \nour Employee Input Panel, an opt-in network that gives \nparticipating staff opportunities to provide feedback on \nprojects and initiatives that will affect their experience. \nTeaming at BCG. We continue to pioneer models that \nfoster effective teaming across the firm. With coaching, \nleadership activation, and engagement at scale, BCG \nsupports teams in adopting behaviors and best practices \nthat the firm has codified through leadership alignment, \nstable team rhythms, psychological safety, and a growth \nmindset. About 115 BCG teaming coaches work with case \nand business services teams at any given time, embedding \nteaming best practices in learning journeys across all \nseniority levels.

BCG\u2019s employees need flexibility and \nadaptability in the workplace, even as they respond to the \ndemands of our clients and business. Our global Flex@BCG \nframework describes different ways of working flexibly across \nthe firm and enables employees to navigate the options \navailable to them. All employees can request time off for \npersonal matters or for a particular passion, and all have a \nright to request part-time work. In addition, all employees \nwho become parents are eligible for parental leave. Finally, \nto increase day-to-day flexibility, we continue to add new \ntools, enablers, and programs and pilot new technologies.\nCareer Mobility. Various job mobility opportunities give \nour people special motivation and options for growth. \nBCG\u2019s Global Career Framework encourages growth \nthrough exploration across topics, practices, and locations. \nWe also curate personalized career development plans for \nour employees, including learning sessions, project \nopportunities, and coaching. We support employee \ndevelopment by offering structured mobility programs, \nposting vacancies on our internal jobs board, and \nhighlighting senior business services leadership roles \nthrough a quarterly all-staff email, as well as by sharing \nopenings with alumni and posting openings externally. \nAffiliation and Fun. Part of our commitment to providing \na best-in-class employee experience involves offering \nopportunities to have fun and meet colleagues outside \nnormal business interactions. These include events such as \nholiday parties, retreats, and community service days, \nwhich give our staff occasions to connect and to build and \nrenew friendships.

We comply \nwith all applicable pay equity laws and regulations, such as \nthe UK\u2019s Gender Pay Gap reporting requirements.

As our own research \ndemonstrates, fostering an inclusive culture is essential to \nattracting and retaining the best talent from all \nbackgrounds. Teams of people with diverse backgrounds \nand experiences are more innovative and better able to \nsolve the world\u2019s toughest problems. Organizations that \ncommit to and invest in DEI are well positioned to navigate \nthe challenges of a rapidly changing business landscape \nand generate better ideas to contribute to long-term \nsustainable growth. \nTo create exceptional value and impact, we seek to attract \nthe best, most diverse talent in the world, and we promote \na fair and inclusive workplace in which all employees thrive. \nWe have a responsibility to advance fairness, dignity, and \nbelonging in our workplace, our client work, and our world. \nDiversity and respect for the individual have been core \nvalues at BCG for years, and we don\u2019t compromise on \nthese values regardless of where we operate. That\u2019s why \nwe\u2019re proud to publicly commit to DEI. We strive to provide \nan inclusive environment where all of our employees can \nflourish. To advance this agenda, we focus on three \nstrategic pillars: inclusion and equity, accountability, and \ndedication to shaping the global societal agenda.\nInclusion and Equity \nBCG is deeply committed to building an equitable and \ninclusive culture that maximizes the benefits of having \nemployees with a wide range of experiences and identities. \nOur research has shown that feelings of inclusion are critical \nto employee happiness, well-being, motivation, and \nretention.

We continue to expand our \nofferings of required and optional DEI training to support \nour teams and leaders throughout their careers at BCG. \nEvery newcomer to BCG receives mandatory, \ncomprehensive DEI training that introduces our core values \nand diverse networks. We embed DEI principles across our \nportfolio of professional development modules, including \nleadership and communications. Our \u201cconscious inclusion\u201d \ninitiatives and DEI-focused events, local and global, help \nensure that diversity, equity, and inclusion are not just \ndiscussed but authentically practiced. This approach \nhighlights our commitment to making diversity a driving \nforce for innovation and success.\nFor example, since 2020, we have partnered with the \nGroundwater Institute to create an immersive learning \nexperience that increases understanding of structural \nracial inequities and works to change systems and improve \noutcomes. To date, more than 800 BCGers have \nparticipated. \nIn addition to offering these training programs, we \nmaintain a BCG-curated, on-demand library of short \ncourses, TED talks, and books on DEI topics, all of which \nare available to all staff.\nMentorship and Affiliation. Mentorship and \nsponsorship are critical to enabling success, particularly \nfor individuals from underrepresented and/or historically \nmarginalized backgrounds. Accordingly, we have \nestablished mentorship and affiliation programs across the \nglobe and for a wide variety of identities, including (but \nnot limited to) women, members of the LGBTQIA+ and \nAccessAbility communities, and individuals from racial \nand ethnic minorities. These programs aim to ensure that \nmembers of our diversity affinity networks have support \nand guidance to succeed at BCG.\nComplementing our mentorship opportunities, our highly \nengaged affinity networks and communities provide \nprogramming, conferences, and affiliation opportunities for \nindividuals with shared identities.17\nSharing Lived Experiences. Around the globe, regional \nteams and local offices create programming and \neducational initiatives on topics of culture and identity to \npromote allyship, raise awareness of ways to advance \ninclusion in the workplace, and enhance psychological \nsafety. Inclusion Accelerators\u2014local office committees \nresponsible for programming and education initiatives on \ntopics of culture and identity\u2014exist in many offices and \nare responsible for driving an inclusive culture through \ntargeted programming. Another initiative is Authentic \nConversations, a series of online and in-person panel \ndiscussions on topics of culture and identity that give \nemployees an opportunity to share their lived experiences \nso they can feel heard, respected, and supported.\nFair and Inclusive Recruitment. Our success depends \non employing passionate, open-minded people who \npossess a range of expertise and experience and who \nrepresent, among other dimensions, all genders, gender \nidentities, gender expressions, sexual orientations, races, \nethnicities, physical abilities, and neurodiversities. This \ndiversity enables us to represent the world we live in, to \nprovide fresh perspectives, to challenge established norms, \nand to devise innovative solutions. It makes us stronger \nand more successful in everything we do. Our recruitment \napproach includes structured evaluation and interview \nprotocols that are designed to eliminate bias from the \nrecruiting process, as well as global MBA fellowships for \ndiverse candidates at several business schools, and \ninternship opportunities for diverse students, including \nBlack/African American, Hispanic/Latino, and Indigenous/\nNative American/Alaska Native students in the US.\nEquitable Career Landscape.

In 2023, we published 25 DEI \narticles with actionable recommendations to drive \nimproved outcomes for ourselves, our clients, and the \nworld at large. Topics included the importance of inclusion, \nhow companies can support people with disabilities, and \ntransgender inclusion. (See \u201cCase Study: First-Time \nInternal Rollout of BCG\u2019s BLISS Survey.\u201d)\nThis work has had a broad impact. Our Trans@Work \narticle was published in the Harvard Business Review. In \nIndia, BCG served as knowledge partner to the G20 \nEmpower Alliance, developing recommendations aimed \nat accelerating women\u2019s leadership and empowerment in \nthe private sector. In Singapore, BCG convened a business \nroundtable to discuss our report Taking Diversity to the Next \nLevel in Southeast Asia and to consider how to collaborate to \nadvance DEI in the region.

Everyone at BCG confirms their \nadherence to the provisions of the Code as a condition of \ntheir employment and must reaffirm their compliance in a \nwritten acknowledgment every year. \nIn 2023, as in prior years, 100% of BCG employees were \nrequired to confirm their understanding of the Code and \nagree to comply with its terms.19 Code training is \nmandatory for all BCGers every two years, and we deliver \nand track it via our online learning platform.

Our aspiration, grounded \nin our company\u2019s values and purpose, is to create a culture \ncommitted to accountability, transparency, honesty, \nhumility, and continuous improvement. A key element of \nthe Code of Conduct, the BCCS underlines our \ncommitment to lead with integrity as we serve our clients, \noperate in our communities, and guide our teams. \nThe BCCS rests on six core principles that address different \ndimensions of our firm\u2019s work.

All \nBCGers are expected to abide by applicable laws, treaties, \nand regulations that prohibit bribery and other corruption, \nincluding the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK \nBribery Act. Accordingly, BCGers must not, either directly \nor indirectly through third parties, offer, attempt to offer, \nsolicit, authorize, or promise any type of bribe or kickback \nto obtain business or an unfair advantage. This policy \npertains to all members of the BCG community, including \nMDPs, officers, employees, contractors, and others with \nwhom we conduct business. We also adhere to fair-\ncompetition regulations and all other laws in the countries \nwhere we do business.\nBCG\u2019s Anti-Bribery & Corruption policy provides guidelines \nfor hospitality, gifts, and other forms of giving to external \nindividuals. BCG\u2019s compliance and legal teams maintain \nclose and continuous engagement with the business, \nproviding support to employees as needed and \nencouraging them to seek guidance through appropriate \nchannels when faced with ambiguous situations. \nIn addition to completing our mandatory Code of Conduct \ntraining, all new BCGers must complete an interactive \nAnti-Bribery & Corruption learning module, which explains \nour values, clarifies the principles of the policy, and \nprovides an overview of bribery and corruption risks and \noffenses, as well as offering guidance on interacting with \ngovernment officials and on identifying and escalating \npotential red flags.

Notably, \nthis commitment includes supporting and respecting the \nprotection of internationally proclaimed human rights and \nensuring that we are not complicit in human rights abuses. \nThe UNGC\u2019s principles are derived from the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights and the International Labor \nOrganization\u2019s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and \nRights at Work, both of which accord with BCG\u2019s values.\nWe have identified that the following topic areas could \npresent salient human rights risks to BCG:20  \n\u2022 Diversity, equity, and inclusion, including, for example, \nequal treatment and opportunities for all, accessibility, \nand measures against workplace harassment \n\u2022 Data privacy and information security \n\u2022 Working conditions \n\u2022 Corporate culture \n\u2022 Safety and security \n\u2022 Protection of whistleblowers \n\u2022 Sustainable procurement\nThe following example illustrates our response to human \nrights risk. For us, as for other other firms in our industry, \nworking with suppliers who do not adhere to fair labor \npractices is a risk that could materialize. BCG expects \nsuppliers to share its commitment to human rights and \nequal opportunity, and we will not knowingly do business \nwith any partner or supplier that violates our policies or \nstandards. Our BCG Supplier Code of Conduct defines \nthese expectations as minimum requirements for suppliers \nseeking to conduct business with us. Further, our UK and \nAustralia Modern Slavery Act reports and Norwegian \nTransparency Act Statements explain our process for \npreventing slavery and human trafficking in our business \nand supply chain. Our global screening program vets \nsuppliers for sanctions, bribery, corruption, and negative \nmedia as indications of each supplier\u2019s historical behavior.\nIn 2023, specifically, BCG initiated a global program to further \nstrengthen the way we assess and manage environmental, \nsocial, and governance (ESG) risk throughout our global \nsupply chain; the priority was to roll out the program in the \nUK and Germany\u2014with a phased global rollout to follow by \nend of 2024\u2014that matches our values and ensures \ncompliance with existing and emerging ESG regulations. \nThese include Germany\u2019s Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, \nand the and the EU\u2019s forthcoming Corporate Sustainability \nDue Diligence Directive. We also appointed a human rights \nofficer to monitor risk management, including for risks \nrelated to human rights and the environment, among our \nsuppliers and in our own business globally.\nMonitoring the effectiveness of our actions so far has taught \nus that continuous improvement is key: horizon scanning \nand internal auditing helped us identify new regulatory \nrequirements, form appropriate responses, and embed \nthem into our human rights risk management process. To \nlearn more about how we identify, assess, act upon, and \nmonitor human rights risks, see \u201cRaising Concerns and \nProtecting Whistleblowers\u201d on page 85. \nBCG is committed to ensuring that all of its employees are \nafforded all applicable rights under law, including the right to \njoin labor unions, works councils, or other collective \nbargaining organizations where applicable. Given the nature \nof our industry and our private partnership model, trade \nunions, works councils, and collective bargaining agreements \n(CBAs) are not commonplace. In some regions, statutory \nCBAs are applicable, and BCG remains compliant with these. \nIn addition, where country-level works councils exist, some \nCBAs have been developed that may contain more favorable \nconditions than the minimum legal requirement.\n20.

Our \nGlobal Security team monitors global trends and potential \nthreats in all locations where BCG operates. We adopt a \nrisk-based approach to ensure the safety of our staff \nmembers during their travels. \nEquipping our employees with advanced, real-time digital \ntools that provide access to travel safety, security, and medical \nsupport and enable immediate one-touch connectivity to our \n24-7 response center is one of our key security strategies. This \nallows employees to make informed decisions that safeguard \ntheir well-being when traveling. For destinations where \nelevated security threats exist, we have a rigorous pretravel \nevaluation, planning, and authorization process overseen by \nour Global Security Committee, which consists of BCG\u2019s chief \nrisk officer, our general counsel, a regional risk leader, and the \nexecutive director for security and sustainability. We partner \nwith leading providers in the security industry to help ensure \nthat our employees have access to security and medical \nsupport, regardless of their location.  \nCreating a Safe and Secure Workplace \nBCG offices implement programs to ensure the health and \nsafety of our employees and visitors, adhering to BCG\u2019s \nphysical security standards, which we fully revised and \nupdated in 2023. These standards set the benchmark for \nsecuring our buildings, offices, and operational processes.  \nOur offices are designed to maximize natural light and provide \nergonomic workstations, enhancing employee well-being and \nsafety. Promoting awareness of health and safety procedures is \nintegral to our approach and is a standard module in our new-\nhire induction process. Employees visiting an office for the first \ntime have access to specific local health and safety procedures.  \nBefore establishing a new office, BCG conducts \ncomprehensive risk assessments to mitigate potential risks \nto our employees and the firm. The Global Security team \nplays an essential role in that work. As noted earlier, our \nAssurance & Advisory team conducts regular reviews of all \nBCG offices, typically on a three- to four-year cycle, \ndepending on the level of risk exposure. These reviews \ninclude assessments of office safety and security protocols \nand practices, reinforcing our commitment to creating safe \nand secure workplaces across our global network. \nBuilding Resilient Operations\nOur global and local Incident Response Teams, led by \nexperienced MDPs and supported by our global team, are \nready to respond to adverse events swiftly and effectively. \nThey receive training and resources to reduce the impact of \nsuch events on our people, operations, and assets. \nIn 2023, we enhanced our business resilience, incident \nresponse capabilities, and disaster recovery processes with \nnew trainings and tools. BCG conducted simulation \nexercises in every office, integrating insights from recent \nglobal events and leveraging and embedding digital \ndynamic response tools and processes that the firm \nintroduced in 2021 and 2022.  \nThe Global Security team intensified its efforts in horizon \nscanning and scenario planning to address the uncertain \ngeopolitical climate. In collaboration with local leaders and \nindustry experts, the team crafted scenarios, provided \nleadership briefings, and established cross-functional security \nworking groups to ensure that BCG is thoroughly prepared for \na wide range of contingencies.

At the same time, because of the \nrapid and widespread popularity of GenAI tools, the public \nbecame aware of the many risks posed by AI and GenAI, \nsuch as biased, toxic, and erroneous content. Government \nofficials seized the opportunity to approve new legislation, \nsuch as the EU AI Act, that has sweeping implications for \nthe commercial deployment of the technology. In this \ncontext, the responsible design and implementation of AI \nmatters more than ever. \nOur clients trust us to help them deliver transformative \nbusiness impact without inadvertently harming people, \ncommunities, or the environment\u2014or compromising \nBCG\u2019s core values.

Our AI Code of Conduct \nfurther codifies BCG\u2019s commitment to responsibly design, \ndevelop, and deploy AI systems both internally and with \nour clients around the world.\nBCG\u2019s RAI policy outlines a set of high-risk areas that \nrequire additional review and approval. These areas involve \nprojects that could have a substantial positive impact on \nsociety and our clients but also pose a higher level of risk. \nProposals for such projects are reviewed by BCG\u2019s \nResponsible AI Team with crucial input from the \nResponsible AI Council (RAIC), a global, cross-functional \ngroup of senior leaders and experts who provide feedback \non each proposal, surfacing risks, defining mitigation \nstrategies, and creating guardrails. BCG also integrates the \nResponsible AI Team into the firm\u2019s processes for AI \nsoftware development to ensure that all mitigation \nstrategies are in place and that the RAIC monitors the \nprogress of each project over time. The Responsible AI \nTeam also scans for new risks and opportunities as they \nemerge, helping to support excellence in the long term. \n2023 Highlights \nBCG enhanced its AI literacy by conducting GenAI training \nsessions for both technical and nontechnical staff, including \ntop executives and managing directors and partners. These \nsessions gave attendees the knowledge they needed to \nincorporate BCG\u2019s RAI principles in the development and \nimplementation of GenAI projects, while also identifying \nnew and heightened risks associated with these tools.\nTo support the responsible use of GenAI, we established a \ncomprehensive Generative AI Guidance page, providing \nup-to-date best practices.

It offers a systematic approach to \ndeveloping a sustainable and responsible supply chain and \nis included in all of BCG\u2019s standard supplier contracts. \nThe SCoC establishes minimum requirements across four \nbroad categories: business practices and ethics; labor \npractices and human rights; environmental regulations and \nprotection; and protection of assets, intellectual property, \nand data. Within the SCoC, we affirm our commitment to \nthe UN Global Compact and our support for the Ten \nPrinciples on human rights, labor, the environment, and \nanticorruption, and we state our expectation that our \nsuppliers will share our commitment to human rights and \nequal opportunity in the workplace. \nThe SCoC also provides a process for suppliers to report \ntheir compliance or noncompliance, including a link to BCG\u2019s \nSpeak Up Line, discussed on page 85. Suppliers and others \ncan use this line to file complaints or notices of violations \nand/or noncompliance by suppliers. The SCoC also informs \nsuppliers of the range of potential BCG responses in the \nevent that a supplier fails to meet SCoC requirements.\nProcurement Policy Framework\nBCG is updating and developing policies and guidelines to \nsupport supplier life cycle management. They will reflect \nBCG\u2019s commitment to sustainable procurement and ESG \ninitiatives and will enhance our governance, compliance, \nand reporting efforts. The Supplier Governance Forum will \ncontinue to provide oversight of the policy framework and \nof BCG\u2019s global supply chain. \nThe proposed framework will underscore our sustainability \nmission and values to ensure that BCG and our suppliers \nimplement sustainable ways of working and follow best \npractices to ensure a balance among planet, people, and \nprofits. The policies and guidelines will include criteria for \nBCG\u2019s preferred suppliers, prescreening and ongoing \nmonitoring of suppliers, supplier assessments, and ESG \ndue diligence initiatives. \nSupplier Sustainability Questionnaires\nOur standard supplier request-for-proposal template includes \na sustainability questionnaire. This gives us the opportunity \nto promote awareness of our commitment to sustainability \nin the supply chain, enable our sourcing teams to use \nsustainability criteria to evaluate new suppliers, and improve \nthe quality of the data we collect to measure sustainability \ncommitments and the performance of new suppliers. \nIn line with our commitment to carbon neutrality, we \nevaluate all supply chain emissions (reported in our Scope \n3 purchased goods and services and capital goods \ncategories). This data helps us make informed decisions \nwhen selecting suppliers, and it enables us to reduce \nemissions for specific supplier categories. \n Singapore - Kashmira and Magno\nSupplier Screening and Monitoring\nWe screen new suppliers to identify any red flags, and we \nmonitor all current suppliers for concerns related to \nsanctions. We have established a protocol for raising red \nflags and escalating issues when we find that suppliers \nrequire additional screening. A periodic report shares the \nscreening results with relevant business stakeholders and \ninternal control groups to ensure effective ongoing \nmanagement of supplier-related risks. \nUS Supplier Diversity Program\nBCG supports diversity and acknowledges the benefits of \ninvesting in diverse businesses. We recognize the important \ncontributions diverse suppliers make in innovation while \ncreating job growth and sustaining our country\u2019s economy. \nDiverse suppliers bring agility and expertise to assist us in \nsupporting our customers and their missions. \nOur program is geared toward strengthening our supplier \nbase in the US and offers a fair bidding process for all \nsuppliers to obtain sourcing opportunities within BCG. Our \nprogram recognizes the need to develop a more robust \nsupplier database and encourages the use of businesses \nowned by minorities, women, veterans, members of the \nLGBTQ+ community, and other diverse supplier entities, as \nwell as small businesses. In 2023, 10% of our US supplier \nspending was with diverse suppliers. We continue to mature \nour supplier diversity program and realize greater benefits \nin partnership with our diverse supplier networks.\nSupply Chain Regulation \nIn recent years, new sustainability laws, such as Germany\u2019s \nSupply Chain Due Diligence Act, demand higher standards \nof supply chain management.

Our GHG emissions \ninventory is independently audited and verified against \nthe ISO 14064-3 standard.\nScope 1 and Scope 2 Emissions\nWe gather energy consumption data from our offices \nglobally. Where possible, we collect actual consumption \ndata from invoices, from landlords, or directly from energy \nsuppliers. When we cannot obtain this data, we use \nindustry benchmarks to estimate energy consumption on \nthe basis of occupied floor space. We follow the Scope 2 \nmarket-based accounting approach to account for our \npurchase of renewable electricity.\nScope 3 Business Travel Emissions\nBusiness travel is our most material emissions source and \nmakes up the majority of our GHG inventory. Our business \ntravel emissions include flights, hotel nights, rail, rental \ncars, and taxis. To calculate those emissions, we use the \ndistances traveled per mode and class of transport and the \nnumber of hotel nights, as provided by our global travel \nagent, and multiply the travel activity by the conversion \nfactors produced by the UK government. To account for \ntravel booked by individuals outside our travel agent \nsystem, we apply a small uplift factor to flight, rail, and \nhotel emissions. For taxi emissions, since we do not have a \nglobal record of all taxi journey mileage, we convert \nexpenses data into mileage using an external benchmark \ndollars-per-mile conversion rate to estimate the total \ndistance traveled. We then look at the average emissions \nintensity (gCO2/Km) for our largest taxi service provider to \nconvert the distance traveled to emissions.\nWhereas all other emissions sources use the latest \navailable emissions factor set, DEFRA 2023, we calculated \nour 2023 air travel emissions using the DEFRA 2022 \nemissions factors. Although it is most common to utilize \nthe factors that align with the reporting year, DEFRA has \nconfirmed that using factors from other years is \npermissible if there is a reasonable justification for doing \nso. The reason for this change is that the DEFRA 2023 \nemission factors rely on load factor data from 2021, when \nthe global aviation industry was severely impacted by the \npandemic, meaning that the calculated carbon intensity of \nevery passenger was far greater than usual.

Although we deem the \nlevel of risk to be low, it is important to understand the \npotential long-term impact of these risks and take action to \nmitigate them. In this section, we summarize our approach \nto managing climate-related risks and opportunities in line \nwith the reporting recommendations of the Task Force on \nClimate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). \nWe provide more detail on our approach to managing \nclimate-related risks and opportunities in our CDP Climate \nDisclosure, available at www.CDP .net.\nGovernance\nBCG\u2019s Internal Sustainability Strategic Committee (Strat \nCo.) oversees the development, implementation, and \nprogress of the firm\u2019s sustainability strategy and net zero \ntarget, including oversight of climate-related risks with \nsupport from the Audit and Risk Committee. The Strat Co., \nwhich currently consists of BCG\u2019s global chair, chief \nsustainability officer, chief financial officer, and people \nchair, meets monthly. All Strat Co. members have their \nannual performance rating and remuneration tied to the \ninternal sustainability performance of the firm. The Strat \nCo. is also supported by three Operations Committees, \nwhich meet monthly to drive operational changes. Finally, \nthe Internal Sustainability Team, led by BCG\u2019s chief \nsustainability officer, David Webb, is responsible for the \nday-to-day operation of the sustainability program.\nStrategy \nAlthough we have a thorough process in place to monitor \nclimate-related risks and our mitigation approach (see \npage 101), we have not identified any risks that could have \na substantive impact on our business. This is primarily \nbecause we are a highly agile and resilient organization, our \nvalue chain is not significantly exposed to climate-related \nrisks, we are not operating in a heavy emitting industry, and \nwe are not subject to substantive climate regulation or \npolicy. In addition, we actively manage our own climate \nimpacts through our industry-leading net zero program. \nThrough our climate-related risk and opportunity \nassessment, we determined that the opportunities linked \nto the low-carbon transition far outweigh the risk. Given \nthe scale of climate adaptation and mitigation, we expect \ndemand for our climate services to continue to increase \nand to come from an expanding range of sectors and \nindustries. To realize this growing opportunity, we continue \nto invest heavily in our climate and environment work and \nhave pledged $2 billion over the next decade to enable our \nteams to drive climate and environmental impact across \ngovernments, industries, NGOs, and coalitions, and to \nadvance global progress toward the Paris agreement. \nWhen establishing our corporate climate strategy, we \nconducted a scenario analysis to assess how to align our \nbusiness with a 1.5\u00b0C trajectory, while taking into \nconsideration numerous transitional risks (reputational, \nmarket, and technological). As a result, we have invested \nheavily in business continuity measures to manage risks to \nour core operations. For example, we mitigate business \ntravel disruptions due to physical risks, such as extreme \nweather, through business continuity planning and \ninvesting in hybrid and remote project team models. BCG\u2019s \nglobal orientation enables us to adapt readily to a wide \nrange of geographically concentrated risks, whether they \nbe physical (such as extreme weather events) or \ntransitional (such as new climate policy or legislation). \nFurthermore, our ongoing investments in client \nsustainability and in internal measures to achieve net zero \nemissions help mitigate any reputational risks that might \nhave a substantive impact.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3885, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0621b45a-7306-4bf4-b59e-6820d8c8e5db": {"__data__": {"id_": "0621b45a-7306-4bf4-b59e-6820d8c8e5db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "101", "file_name": "2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\Ai\\OneDrive\\Programm\\GitHub\\HF_Projects\\src\\input\\PDF\\2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 23435861, "creation_date": "2025-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6620edcf-3442-4e28-afba-54625c92a932", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "101", "file_name": "2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\Ai\\OneDrive\\Programm\\GitHub\\HF_Projects\\src\\input\\PDF\\2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 23435861, "creation_date": "2025-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-17"}, "hash": "d5b5ce8bce91643ef4215458942c9cfb0d6e1748e4967ff62c6cfc8026493e87", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP APPENDIX  |  2023 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT       101\nRisk Management\nAt BCG, we have defined three processes for monitoring \nand managing climate-related risks as part of our \nframework for enterprise risk management:\n\u2022 Climate Change Risk Assessment. First, we conduct \na climate change risk assessment (CCRA), which looks \nat physical and transitional climate-related risks and \nopportunities across BCG\u2019s value chain. We assess \nthe likelihood, impact, management approach, and \neffectiveness of each risk across short-, medium-, and \nlong-term time horizons and under +1.5\u00b0C and +4\u00b0C \nwarming scenarios. We update our CCRA twice per year, \nor as new global climate risks emerge, and our Strat Co. \nreviews it annually.\n\u2022 Enterprise Risk Management Integration. Second, \nwe review the output from the CCRA and integrate \nit into the global enterprise risk management (ERM) \nframework. We also share the output with the Audit and \nRisk Committee yearly, and we communicate the key \nrisks to the MDP group through the annual risk report. \n\u2022 Local Risk Assessment. Third, the global safety and \nsecurity team is responsible for managing physical risks \nto BCG offices, including chronic and acute climate-\nrelated physical risks. In developing and maintaining \nBCG\u2019s business continuity and resiliency plan, the Safety \nand Security team identifies relevant risks and develops \nmitigation and resilience plans at the local level.\nAs explained in the strategy section above, although we \nhave a robust risk assessment process, we have not \nidentified any risks that could have a substantive impact on \nour business.\nMetrics and Targets\nAs explained in the strategy section on page 100, the \nincrease in client revenue from climate and sustainability \nconsulting projects presents the greatest opportunity to \nBCG. Accordingly, we monitor and report the performance \nand growth of our climate and sustainability client work. In \n2023, we delivered approximately 1,500 climate and \nsustainability projects, a year-on-year increase of over 50%. \nWe also invested a further $240 million in planetary \nobjectives in 2023, in the form of cash or in-kind support. \nIn addition, we track our carbon emissions globally \n(reported on page 52) and our progress toward our science-\nbased targets (reported on page 51). We also monitor the \ncost savings associated with achieving our emissions \nreduction targets and the program costs associated with \ndelivering our net-zero strategy (including carbon credit \nand renewable energy certificate purchases). We disclose \nour implicit carbon price ($18 per metric ton in 2023), \nwhich we expect could rise to approximately $80 per metric \nton by 2030.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2712, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad0fced3-06a8-4302-906a-f58f0021c968": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad0fced3-06a8-4302-906a-f58f0021c968", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\Ai\\OneDrive\\Programm\\GitHub\\HF_Projects\\src\\input\\PDF\\2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 23435861, "creation_date": "2025-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "07d6d1a4-a741-4c19-a3de-aabb23d13e90", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\Ai\\OneDrive\\Programm\\GitHub\\HF_Projects\\src\\input\\PDF\\2023-Annual-Sustainability-Report-April-2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 23435861, "creation_date": "2025-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-17"}, "hash": "2f7bf30368c9c03bfed56668cb7781a4d199bacfff3da6e8337741f5a61a5517", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP APPENDIX  |  2023 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT       102\nPerformance Data Tables\nNote: A dash in place of a data point in any cell of this table indicates either that no target or target year has been set or that data was not \navailable to report.\n1.

BCG uses a sector-level materiality screening tool to identify the most material impacts and dependencies on nature for our sector and sub-\nindustry. BCG does not own real estate and only leases offices in urban centers. That\u2019s why our economic activities, such as infrastructure holding \nprocesses, were not found to have a medium, high or very high dependency on ecosystem services or natural capital. For the same reason, we do \nnot apply medium, high or very high pressure on ecosystem services or natural capital either. Our double materiality assessment corroborates \nthese findings. Nevertheless, BCG commits to supporting programs that protect and nurture nature and biodiversity, as found in the \u201cKeeping \nTrack of Key Environmental Topics\u201d section (page 60).
